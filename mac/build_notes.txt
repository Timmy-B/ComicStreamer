Prepping a fresh mac for CS and CT:

Works with Snow Leopard 32 or 64:

#install XCode
#install homebrew

brew install git
brew install webp
brew install pyqt
brew install unrar
brew install homebrew/python/pillow
brew install libyaml
pip install configobj
pip install configparser
pip install python-dateutil
pip install watchdog
pip install tornado
pip install sqlalchemy
pip install pybonjour --allow-external pybonjour --allow-unverified pybonjour
pip install natsort
pip install pyinstaller


pip install pyobjc-core
pip install pyobjc

#-------------------------


Some tweaks that were neeeded:
	After the full build/install of PyObjC, needed to add a __init__.py file in PyObjCTools folder
	Needed to add extra "import" statements to rumps.py: AppKit, Foundation
	Needed to rebuild the Pyinstaller Mac 32-bit bootloader after removing the line to run the app in the foreground

------------------------
My Question was how to compile it under osx but I almost already answered that myself.

Stuck with the init patch and the other one...

Hi! how do I compile this under OSX (and I mean fork 0.8 https://github.com/kounch/ComicStreamer)

http://catmonkey.nl/Share/ComicStreamer-0.0.9.dmg

Update It runs!

I followed the two hints there where resulting in:
osx 10.11
xcode 7.3 & brew

brew install git
brew install webp
brew install pyqt
brew install unrar
brew install homebrew/python/pillow
brew install libyaml
pip install PyPDF2
pip install pylzma
pip install configobj
pip install configparser
pip install python-dateutil
pip install watchdog
pip install tornado
pip install sqlalchemy
pip install pybonjour --allow-external pybonjour --allow-unverified pybonjour
pip install natsort
pip install pyinstaller
pip install pillow
pip install unrar
pip install pyobjc-core
pip install pyobjc

-- PDF stuff (should probably be included in the OSX version)
brew install mupdf-tools
brew unlink mupdf-tools
brew install homebrew/x11/mupdf

Download 3.2 and developer version from http://www.pyinstaller.org
Unzip in same parent folder as the ComicsStreamer folder (not "in" the ComicStreamer folder) 
Rename developer folder to pyinstaller-develop
Patch mac/Makefile replace pyinstaller-2.0 with pyinstaller-3.2
Patch mac/Makefile replace 'which rar' with '-a ../libunrar' thus making/reading cp -a ../libunrar $(APP_BUNDLE)/Contents/MacOS
Download http://www.rarlab.com/rar_add.htm unrar source http://www.rarlab.com/rar/unrarsrc-5.3.11.tar.gz (or newer)
Compile libunrar.so with make lib -f makefile
Move libunrar.so to libunrar folder in the ComicStreamer source

Goto: mac/Makefile folder run make...

I did nothing with the init or rumps whatever... runs when I start it from within the Contents/MacOSX folder :-) 
Ow I get it... the icon is not hidden and the package will not start but.. unless you run it from the terminal... and it does not contain the mudraw tool...

So now what? how do i fix that...

Maybe somebody add this to a readme!
